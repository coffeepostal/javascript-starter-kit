# JavaScript Starter Kit (JSSK)
I was inspired by [Cory House's](https://github.com/coryhouse) [talk on creating a JavaScript Starter Kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGCWal_JWek), so this is my attempt at it.

This is a work in process, so I'll flesh out sections as I get to them, if the section below has no content, it's still being built.
